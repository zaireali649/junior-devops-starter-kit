# From Student to Junior DevOps Engineer: A Real-World Interview Guide

---

## Introduction

This guide is for aspiring Junior DevOps Engineers preparing for interviews. It’s grounded in real-world experience from multiple technical interviews and project work. You’ll learn what companies actually care about, how to prepare for interviews, and what kinds of projects will help you stand out.

Whether you're a bootcamp grad, IT support specialist, or self-taught technologist, this guide is designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

## 1. What Companies Look for in Junior DevOps Engineers

### Core Tools and Technologies

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI  
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (IAM, S3, EC2, RDS, Lambda)  
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform  
- **Containers**: Docker, ECS (or basic EKS knowledge)  
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, Datadog  
- **Security**: IAM, GitHub Secrets, security groups  

### Mindset and Expectations

- You’re not expected to be an expert—just curious, consistent, and security-conscious.  
- Employers want to see **working solutions**, **good documentation**, and **clean troubleshooting** practices.  
- Be ready to explain trade-offs in tooling and design decisions.

## 2. Projects That Make You Stand Out

Real-world projects demonstrate initiative, understanding of automation, and ability to work with cloud tools. These projects should be hosted on GitHub, well-documented, and include CI/CD.

### Prompt Deployment Pipeline | Amazon Bedrock + S3 + GitHub Actions

**Use Case**: Automate AI-powered content creation and publishing for static sites

- GitHub CI/CD workflow to render prompt templates and send to Bedrock (Claude)  
- Outputs saved as HTML/Markdown and uploaded to S3  
- Environment-based prefixes (`beta/`, `prod/`) separate test and live outputs  
- Secrets handled via GitHub Actions  

---

### Multilingual Audio Pipeline | Amazon Transcribe + Translate + Polly + S3 + GitHub Actions

**Use Case**: Automate voice-to-voice translation of `.mp3` files

- Python script uploads `.mp3` files to S3  
- Transcribes, translates, and regenerates multilingual audio  
- Output folders: `transcripts/`, `translations/`, `audio_outputs/`  
- CI/CD for beta and prod branches via GitHub Actions  

---

### Two-Tier Web Architecture on AWS | EC2 + RDS + VPC + Terraform + GitHub Actions

**Use Case**: Deploy a secure and scalable web application using IaC

- Terraform provisions VPC, subnets, routing, EC2 (web), and RDS (database)  
- Security groups isolate tiers (EC2 in public, RDS in private)  
- GitHub Actions handles CI/CD:  
  - `terraform fmt`, `plan` on pull request  
  - `apply` on merge for dev/staging environments  
- Environment-specific credentials secured via GitHub Secrets  
- Validated infrastructure by confirming app and DB connectivity  

---

### EC2 Shutdown Automation | AWS Lambda + GitHub Actions + CloudFormation

**Use Case**: Cut non-prod EC2 costs with daily automated shutdown

- Python Lambda identifies EC2 instances by tag and stops them  
- Triggered via EventBridge at 7 PM daily  
- Lambda packaged in S3 and deployed via CloudFormation  
- GitHub Actions manages deployment workflows for beta and prod  

---

### Docker Deployment to ECS | GitHub Actions + Amazon ECR + ECS

**Use Case**: Deploy Dockerized apps using GitHub CI/CD

- GitHub Actions builds and pushes Docker image to ECR  
- ECS task definition is updated and service is redeployed  
- Separate configurations for beta and prod services  
- AWS credentials managed securely with GitHub Secrets  

---

### Terraform Deployment with GitHub Actions

**Use Case**: Automate Terraform-based infrastructure deployments

- GitHub Actions workflow uses `hashicorp/setup-terraform`  
- Runs `init`, `fmt`, `plan`, and `apply`  
- Branch-based deployment logic (PR for plan, main for apply)  
- Linting and workspace logic handled in reusable workflows  
- Environment variables and secrets secured in GitHub Secrets  

---

## 3. Core Technical Skills and Concepts

### CI/CD

- Understand how to create and trigger workflows in GitHub Actions  
- Learn conditionals (run on PRs, file changes)  
- Handle secrets and environment-specific configurations  

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- Write and validate Terraform modules  
- Use variable files for staging vs production  
- Understand Terraform state and locking  

### Cloud (AWS)

- Launch EC2, create IAM roles, store in S3  
- Use RDS securely within VPC  
- Create and schedule Lambda functions  
- Use EventBridge for task scheduling  
- Apply principle of least privilege  

### Containers

- Build and tag Docker images  
- Push images to ECR  
- Understand Dockerfiles and health checks  
- ECS deployment basics  

### Monitoring and Observability

- Create CloudWatch Alarms for Lambda or EC2  
- Understand structured logs vs plain logs  
- Send logs or metrics to Datadog

## 4. Behavioral Interview Preparation

### Common Patterns

- Tell me about a time you automated something.  
- Describe a time something broke in production. How did you handle it?  
- How do you manage learning new tools?  
- What DevOps tools are you most comfortable with?  

### Strong Answers Include

- The problem you were solving  
- The specific action you took  
- The impact on the team or system  
- Why you chose a particular approach/tool

## 5. Technical Interview Questions (Curated for Junior DevOps)

These are adapted from actual interviews and scoped to a junior level.

### CI/CD

**Beginner:**
- What is a GitHub Actions workflow?  
- How do you securely store secrets in GitHub Actions?

- What tools are you currently using for CI/CD and IaC?  
- Do you have staging environments?  
- How are incidents handled?  
- What’s the biggest DevOps challenge your team is working on?  

---

## 7. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Trying to use buzzwords instead of showing clarity  
- Ignoring security or not understanding IAM  
- Overengineering projects without testing basic functionality  
- Not knowing what your code is doing (copy-paste trap)  
- Skipping documentation and version control best practices

## Final Thoughts

This guide isn’t theory—it’s rooted in experience. Focus on building, documenting, and reflecting. If you treat DevOps as both a craft and a service to your team, you will stand out—even at the junior level.
